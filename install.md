Use a prying tool to pry between the PCB and the metal back cover, start from the top left corner. Be careful not to cut yourself with the sharp edges of the tool or the back cover. Be careful not to bend the back cover.

Once the PCB comes off, peel any remaining double sided tape off the back cover. If there are any adhesive remaining, it's fine, it can help the new PCB to stick to the back cover.

Safety warnings
---------------------
- The prying tool can have some rough edges, it is recommended to wear some protective gloves when prying the PCB, to avoid cuts to your hand. Or wrap the tool with some painter's tape.
- As with any device using Li-Po battery, don't dismantle or damage the battery. Don't discharge the battery to a very low state. Please charge the battery as soon as you see the red LED blinks to ensure the longevity of the battery.
